Update System Pseudocode
------------------------

Read the packet
If the packet is null
	check for error
	if error
		log it
	return

Switch on the packet type
	case packet 2:
		Get the client's player (maybe index 0? need some way of getting their entity)
		Update the player component related to that entity (name, etc)
	
	case packet 3:
		Loop through the players in the packet
			If the player is valid and their info hasn't been recorded
				Create a new player entity
				Copy the player's name to the entity's player component
				Store the player's team number in the entity's player component
				Store the entity number in the corresponding index of the lookup table
				// Ignore the ready status for now
	
	case packet 4:
		// Do nothing, because this is a milestone 2 packet
	
	case packet 6:
		// Do nothing, since there's no floor system yet
	
	case packet 7:
		// I don't know. There's something relevant about this now with floors
	
	case packet 8:
		// Somehow deal with the objectives; need a new way to do this
	
	case packet 9:
		// Nothing for milestone 1. This is the "server auto-find" packet.
	
	case packet 11:
		Loop through the players in the packet
			If it's our player
				Continue
			Update the player's position, floor, velocity
	
	case packet 13:
		// Do nothing for now, since this is (yet another) floor update packet
	
	case packet 1:
	case packet 5:
	case packet 10:
	case packet 12:
	default:
		log error // something must have gone wrong if we got one of these
		return
